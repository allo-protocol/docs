</div>

Allo Protocol is a set of smart contracts that enable the democratic allocation
and distribution of capital. The protocol was developed by [ Gitcoin
](https://www.gitcoin.co/) to power the Grants Stack, but is useful beyond
grants and quadratic funding.

### Why a Protocol for Capital Allocation?

Web3 has given us an incredible set of tools for forming capital, and
democratic ways of keeping that capital safe. But very little of the money raised gets
allocated back into the community. Instead, it sits in treasuries while governance forums
deliberate over peanut-sized funding decisions.

Why?
Every proposal has root-level access to the treasury and the entire
community gets to weigh in on every funding decision.

**Allo** gives communities a tool set to experiment with capital allocation. Pick
a mechanism (like [Quadratic Funding](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-grants-program/mechanisms/quadratic-funding)),
eligibility criteria for projects and voters, and a way to distribute the capital
(lump sum, milestone-based payments, etc).

Instead of choosing from a list of options put together not because they'll serve
you best, but because its whats available, we charge communities to ask - "If our
mechanism could look like anything, what would we want?"

...and build it.

### Current Status

Allo v2 is live on mainnets ([supported networks](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/main/contracts/README.md)).

Allo 2.1 is in pre-release testnet.


## Allo Protocol vs the Grants Stack

In addition to Allo Protocol, Gitcoin offers a suite of products called the
[Grants Stack](https://www.gitcoin.co/grants-stack).

Allo Protocol is for building applications with novel capital allocation
mechanisms, like quadratic funding. The protocol contains a registry of
recipients ([Project Registry](https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/overview/registry)), a way to create
pools of capital ([Pools](https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/overview/pool)), and a strategy
for allocating that pool of capital ([Allocation
Strategy](https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/overview/allocation-strategy)). Anyone building
custom tools for communities to allocate capital or for projects to receive
capital should use Allo.

The [Grants Stack](https://www.gitcoin.co/grants-stack) is a product layer built
on Allo for hosting a grants program. It powers fully-featured self-serve funding 
rounds utilizing a [variety of methods](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-grants-program/mechanisms).
