  <h1 className="font-extrabold text-4xl title">Allo Protocol</h1>
  <p className="text-xl">A general purpose protocol for the efficient allocation of capital.</p>
</div>

Allo Protocol is a set of smart contracts that enable the democratic allocation
and distribution of capital. The protocol was developed by [ Gitcoin
](https://www.gitcoin.co/) to power the Grants Stack, but is useful beyond
grants and quadratic funding.

### Why a Protocol for Capital Allocation?

Crypto has given us an incredible set of tools for forming capital: token drops,
NFTs, treasury diversifications, staking and yield, etc. It has also given us
democratic and secure ways of keeping that capital safe: Safe, Governor Bravo,
among others. But very little of the money raised gets allocated back into the
community. Instead, it sits in treasuries while flame wars wage on in governance
forums over peanut-sized funding decisions.

Why?

Well every proposal has root-level access to the treasury and the entire
community gets to weight in on every funding decision.

Allo gives communities a tool set to experiment with capital allocation. Pick
a mechanism (like Quadratic Funding), eligibility criteria for projects and
voters, and how to distribute the capital (lump sum, milestone-based payments,
etc).

Our hope is that communities will use Allo to build and experiment with multiple
different ways of allocating and distributing capital in their community and
that the movement of tokens will unlock communities to grow and achieve their
missions.

### Use Cases

- Grants Tooling
- Bounties and Requests for Proposals
- Creating circular economic systems
- Quadratic Funding
- Mechanism design and experimentation
- Wrapped voting

### Current Status

We are live on mainets, please see the `main` branch of the [ `allo-v2`
](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/) repository on GitHub for our 
[supported networks](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/main/contracts/README.md).

High-level dates on the 2024 roadmap (WIP):

## Allo Protocol vs the Grants Stack

In addition to Allo Protocol, Gitcoin offers a suite of products called the
[Grants Stack](https://www.gitcoin.co/grants-stack).

Allo Protocol is for people building applications with novel capital allocation
mechanisms, like quadratic funding. The protocol contains a registry of
recipients ([Project Registry](https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/overview/project-registry)), a way to create
pools of capital ([Pools](https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/overview/pool)), and a strategy
for allocating that pool of capital ([Allocation
Strategy](https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/overview/allocation-strategy)). Anyone building
custom tools for communities to allocate capital or for projects to receive
capital should use Allo.

The [Grants Stack](https://www.gitcoin.co/grants-stack) is a self-service suite
of products for hosting a grants program. For now, it lets you run Gitcoin-style
quadratic funding rounds in your ecosystem, but will expand into other forms of
grants over time. The product suite offers everything you'd need to run your
grants program without writing any code. So if you just want to run your grants
program, the [Grants Stack](https://www.gitcoin.co/grants-stack) is a good fit
for you.
