Pools are tied to strategies in Allo. While the
terms of how a pool of capital will be allocated/distributed are reserved
for the strategy contract, those contracts should not be called directly.
Instead, a pool will be created that links to the strategy and all interactions
with that strategy will happen through `Allo.sol`.

Pool functions are contained in `Allo.sol`. This means that to allocate funds
according to the rules in a strategy you will call the `allocate()` function in
`Allo.sol` and provide the pool id (for example).

## Pool Lifecycle

Before creating a pool:

1. Create and deploy a custom strategy, or choose a cloneable strategy.
2. Register on the Project registry.
3. Determine who the pool manager(s) will be.

### Starting and Running a Pool

1. Use the `createPool()` or `createPoolWithCustomStrategy()` function to
   initialize the pool. The pool can be funded during initialization, or at
   a later time using the `fundPool()` function. See the code samples in
   [Creating a Pool](#creating-a-pool) for more details.

2. Determine the recipients of the pool and add them using
   `registerRecipient()`. What data is required to register a recipient will
   depend on the underlying strategy. `Allo.sol` also provides
   `batchRegisterRecipient()`, which will register a single recipient to
   multiple pools. Both functions return the `recipientId`, which will be
   needed for distributing funds.

```javascript
const tx = await allo.registerRecipient(poolId, bytes(""));

const tx = await allo.batchRegisterRecipient(poolIds, bytes[]);
```

3. When allowed by the strategy contract, have allocators allocate funds using
   `allocate()` or `batchAllocate()`. `batchAllocate()` is used to allocate
   funds to multiple pools and may not be available for all strategies. The data
   required to allocate funds will be determined by the underlying strategy.

```javascript
const tx = await allo.allocate(poolId, bytes(""));

const tx = await allo.batchAllocate(poolIds, bytes[]);
```

4. Once allocation is complete, complete the pool's funds can be distributed
   using `distribute()`. You will need the `recipientId` returned when they were
   registered. Again, specifics of how distribute will behave is determined by
   the strategy.

```javascript
const tx = await allo.distribute(
    poolId, recipientIds[], bytes("")
);

const tx = await allo.batchAllocate(poolIds, bytes[]);
```

5. If any funds are remaining after distribution, use `recoverFunds()` to remove
   them from the pool. Only the `poolOwner` is allowed to use `recoverFunds()`.

```javascript
const tx = await allo.recoverFunds(
    tokenAddress, recipientAddress
);
```

## Creating a Pool

There are two methods available for creating a pool, `createPool()` and
`createPoolWithCustomStrategy()`.

### `createPool()`

The `createPool()` function should be used when you want to use a cloneable
strategy from the Allo library. An error will occur if the strategy address
provided is not approved as a cloneable strategy.

```javascript
const allo = await ethers.getContractAt('Allo', alloProxyAddress, signer);

const profileId = "registry profile id here";
const strategyAddress = "cloneable strategy address";
const initData = "0x";
const tokenAddress = "0x7af963cf6d228e564e2a0aa0ddbf06210b38615d";     //Goerli test token
const amount = 0;
const metadata = {protocol: 1, pointer: "strategy pointer"};
const managers = ["your wallet here"];

const tx = await allo.createPool(
   profileId, strategyAddress, initData, tokenAddress, amount, metadata, managers
);
await tx.wait();
console.log(`Done! Transaction hash: ${tx.hash}`)
```

### `createPoolWithCustomStrategy()`

`createPoolWithCustomStrategy()` can be used with custom strategies, as the name
suggests. The strategy must be deployed before the pool is created. 

```javascript
const allo = await ethers.getContractAt('Allo', alloProxyAddress, signer);

const profileId = "registry profile id here";
const strategyAddress = "0x4AB4eF1aa0c2f63FFE77b245E679fb7B38681470";  //Donation Voting address
const initData = "0x";
const tokenAddress = "0x7af963cf6d228e564e2a0aa0ddbf06210b38615d";     //Goerli test token
const amount = 0;
const metadata = {protocol: 1, pointer: "strategy pointer"};
const managers = ["your wallet here"];

const tx = await allo.createPoolWithCustomStrategy(
   profileId, strategyAddress, initData, tokenAddress, amount, metadata, managers
);
await tx.wait();
console.log(`Done! Transaction hash: ${tx.hash}`)
```
