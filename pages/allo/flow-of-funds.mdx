# Flow of Funds

While there is nuance in how pools get allocated by Strategies,  there are
generally four steps in the life cycle of a pool.
Each step is invoked on [`Allo.sol`](/allo), which calls the relevent
method on the strategy.

## Creating a pool

The Allo core contract has two methods for creating a pool:

1. The [`createPool`](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2.1/blob/dev/contracts/core/Allo.md#create-pool) method
2. The [`createPoolWithCustomStrategy`](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2.1/blob/dev/contracts/core/Allo.md#create-a-pool-with-custom-strategy) method

This first method for creating a pool creates a new pool by
cloning an already deployed one. This makes it simple to make use of existing
on-chain strategies. If you're using a custom or newly developed strategy, then you
would deploy it to chain, and use the second method (`createPoolWithCustomStrategy`).

Some things to note:
- Pools must be created by a Profile from the Registry
- Pools can be created with an initial balance of 0 and funded later
- By default, anyone can fund a pool

## Funding a Pool

A pool can be funded when it is created and/or it can be funded afterwards. You
can do either or you can do both. If funding the pool after creating it, then use
* The [**`fundPool`**](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2.1/blob/dev/contracts/core/Allo.md#fund-pool)
method 

Pools can be funded with either native Ether or an ERC20 token. Note though
that a pool can only distribute one token, which is determined when the pool is
created. Trying to call `fundPool` with a token other than the one used when the
pool was created will cause the method to revert with an error. **Pools should
always be funded using the `fundPool` method and **you should never transfer funds
directly to `Allo.sol`**

Once a pool has been funded, there is no way to withdraw funds from the pool
bypassing the terms defined by the strategy. Strategies will have a
[`withdraw`](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2.1/tree/dev/contracts/strategies#functions)
method, though conditions for its use will vary.

Some things to note:
- The address that creates the pool doesn't have to be the one that funds it
- Pools can only distribute one token (including native Ether)
- Never directly transfer funds to `Allo.sol`

## Allocating Funds

While strategies define the terms of allocation, the act of allocating is done
through `Allo.sol`. This provides a consistent interface for use.
* The [`allocate`](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2.1/blob/dev/contracts/core/Allo.md#allocate-funds-to-strategy)
method

Some things to note:
- Allocate can probably only be called by pool managers
- Strategies can be simple or complex. You can read more about them [here](/strategies).

## Distributing Funds

Again, strategies define the terms of distribution, but the method is invoked
through `Allo.sol`. This provides a consistent interface for use.
* The [`distribute`](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2.1/blob/dev/contracts/core/Allo.md#distribute-funds-to-recipients)
method

Some things to note:
- Distribute can probably only be called by pool managers
- Allocation strategies are responsible for managing how a pool is distributed, not `Allo.sol`
