# Flow of Funds

While there is a lot of nuance in how pools get allocated by Allocation
Strategies, generally speaking there are four steps in the life cycle of a pool.
Each step is handled by the Allo core contract (`Allo.sol`), though some of
these methods are implemented by the allocation strategy attached to a pool.

A pool's allocation strategy is what determines how funds are both allocated and
distributed. But to make implementing consistent front ends on Allo easier,
allocation strategies assume that they are being called by `Allo.sol`, which
implements an `allocate()` and `distribute()` method

## Creating a pool

The Allo core contract has two methods for creating a pool:

1. The `createPool` method
2. The `createPoolWithCustomStrategy` method

While there are some differences between the two methods, they both create
a pool for a given Profile in the Registry, and associate an allocation strategy
to it. You can read more about the differences between the two and which to use
in [Working with Pools](/allo/working-with-pools).

Finally, you can create and fund the pool simultaneously through both methods or
you can create the pool and then fund it separately with the `fundPool` method
on `Allo.sol`.

Some things to note:
- Pools must be created by a Profile from the Registry
- Pools can be created with an initial balance of 0 and funded later
- Technically, anyone can fund a pool

## Funding a Pool

A pool can be funded when it is created and/or it can be funded afterwards. You
can do either or you can do both. If funding the pool after creating it, then you'll use the `fundPool` method on `Allo.sol`. 

Pools can also be funded with either native Ether or an ERC20 token. Note though
that a pool can only distribute one token, which is determined when the pool is
created. Trying to call `fundPool` with a token other than the one used when the
pool was created will cause the method to revert with an error. Pools should
always be funded using the `fundPool` method and you should never transfer funds
directly to `Allo.sol`

Once a pool has been funded, there is no way to withdraw funds from the pool
other than to distribute them through the allocation strategy.

Some things to note:
- The address that creates the pool doesn't have to be the one that funds it
- Technically, anyone can fund a pool
- The protocol fee is taken on the pool
- Pools can only distribute one token (including native Ether)
- Never send funds to `Allo.sol`. Funds sent to `Allo.sol` are considered a gift
    to the Allo protocol team and will be used to buy pizza. If you ask nicely,
    we'll share the pizza with you.

## Allocating Funds

While allocation strategies handle the implementation of allocating a pool,
the act of allocating is done through `Allo.sol`. This allows for
interoperability between strategies and gives every front end built on Allo
a consistent interface for every strategy. So allocating to any pool, using any
allocation strategy should be done through the `allocate()` method on
`Allo.sol`.

Every pool is created with one allocation strategy that follows
[`IStrategy.sol`](). The allocation strategy of a pool cannot be changed once
the pool is created.

Some things to note:
- Regardless of your allocation strategy, you'll call `allocate()` on `Allo.sol`
- Writing allocation strategies is a large topic and you can read more about it [here](/strategies).

## Distributing Funds

Any distribution from any pool, using any allocation strategy will be done
through the `distribute()` method on `Allo.sol`. This is for the same reasons
that every allocation is done through `allocate()`: to provide a consistent
interface for front ends and make strategies interoperable (a front end
shouldn't need to care what allocation strategy a pool is using).

What happens when someone called `distribute()` is determined by the allocation
strategy.

It's important to note here that Allo keeps track of a pool's total balance, but the
allocation strategy should keep track of each distribution to avoid things like
double spending or over spending.

Some things to note:
- Regardless of your allocation strategy, you'll call `distribute()` on `Allo.sol`
- Allocation strategies are responsible for managing how a pool is distributed, not `Allo.sol`
