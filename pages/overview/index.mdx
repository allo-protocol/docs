Allo's on-chain components are made up of the following:

* A central contract [**`Allo.sol`**](/allo) used to create and interact with
[**Pools**](/overview/pool) (some concentration of capital)
* Customizable contracts called [**Strategies**](/overview/allocation-strategy) that
implement unique funding or allocation methods to control the flow in and out of Pools
* A central [**`Registry.sol`**](overview/registry) serving as an on-chain registry of
projects, useful for reputation, eligibility, and more

Of these three components, the Strategy is where builders would customize and deploy
to-chain themselves. In most cases, you should use the already deployed
Allo and Registry contracts.
Each of these is explained further in the next sections of the documentation.
