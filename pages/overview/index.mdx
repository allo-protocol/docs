Allo Protocol is made up of the following components:

* A core contract that acts as a [ **Pool** ](/overview/pool) manager
* Custom contracts, called [**Allocation Strategies**](/overview/allocation-strategy) that control how a pool is distributed 
* A [**Project Registry**](overview/registry). This is a universal, on-chain registry of projects used for reputation and eligibility

Each of these is explained further in the next sections of the documentation.
