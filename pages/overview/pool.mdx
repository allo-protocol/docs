# Pool

Allo generalizes capital in to pools, which are created and owned by a profile (project)
in the [registry](/overview/registry). Since a pool of capital is not useful
without a way to control it, they are created with a
[strategy](/overview/allocation-strategy) to determine how the funds are
flowing and are distributed.

For example, if a DAO wanted to hold a quarterly vote to distribute some of its
treasury among community projects, then it might create a new pool each quarter.
Projects, represented by profiles in the registry, apply to receive funding
from the quarterly pool. The allocation strategy determines who is eligible to
receive funding, who can vote, and how funds are allocated and distributed.
Great freedom is given to strategy writers for how to implement these details.

If the DAO uses [Quadratic Funding](https://allo.expert/mechanisms/quadratic-funding)
then members of the DAO donate to the projects they want to support. Each donation is
a 'vote' for how much of the pool that project should receive. When voting is
finished, the pool distribution is calculated and distributed to recipients.
