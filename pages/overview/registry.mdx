# Project Registry

The project registry is a universal, on-chain registry of anyone receiving or
distributing capital through Allo. Once registered, a project can create pools
of funding tied to that profile, or apply to receive funding from another pool in
Allo. Profiles in the registry roughly equate to organizations, and can
distribute and/or receive funding in Allo. We imagine some projects will do
both. We also imagine the registry of projects will be useful beyond Allo.

The goal of the Registry is to help projects accrue reputation and enhance
discoverability for both projects seeking funding, and operators wanting to
distribute capital to the most meaningful projects.

## Project Profiles

When a project registers, it is given a unique address used to
represent it on-chain. This address can be used for many things, including:

* Receiving funds distributed through an allocation strategy
* Be the subject of an attestation (i.e. attesting to the project managers having been KYC'ed)
* Hold a Soul-bound Token demonstrating that the project is a member of a larger community, like a DAO

Because projects are represented by addresses, allocation strategies can include
automated eligibility checks - like checking the balance of SBT.
