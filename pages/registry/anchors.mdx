# IDs and Anchors

There are two unique identifiers in the Allo registry, Ids and Anchors.
Both can be used to represent a project, but they serve different purposes
within the Allo ecosystem.

## Profile Ids
Profile ids are a permanent, internal representation of a project. They are 
returned when a profile is created and are derived from the nonce and sender 
address. 

Profile Ids are generally not used outside of the project registry, except to 
create a pool in `Allo.sol`. 

## Anchors
Anchors are an on-chain address that represents the project globally.

When a profile is created, an `Anchor.sol` contract is deployed and an anchor 
address is assigned. Anchors are mutable, and are updated whenever the project 
name is changed.

Anchors serve two main functions in the registry:
1. They serve as a project escrow account. 
Funds can be sent to and withdrawn from the anchor address.

2. The anchor can accrue reputation for the project. 
It can represent the project in any attestations, be used as a soul-bound 
token, or used as a pointer in a registry.

## Compare and Contrast
| ID | Anchor|
| --- | --- |
| persistent, stable | mutable, unstable |
| internal | external |
| | Can receive funds |
| | Can hold tokens |
