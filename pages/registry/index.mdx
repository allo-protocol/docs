The [Allo Registry](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2.1/blob/dev/contracts/core/Registry.md)
is intended to be used as a resource for all Allo participants. Registry data
can be used to establish trust between parties, build new tools, or offer
insights into the ecosystem.

The core component of the registry is the profile. Profiles contain information
about groups and individuals who wish to be part of the Allo ecosystem. Once
a profile has been created, it can be used to run or participate in pools. All
registry data, including profiles and event details, are stored on-chain and can
be accessed on-chain or through an [Indexer](/overview/indexer).

## Building on the Project Registry

The registry also offers builders the chance to create tooling for the Allo
ecosystem. Some examples of what registry data could be used to create include:

* Dashboards visualizing grant distribution data
* Incentive programs based on Allo events
* Targeted recruitment for pools
* Impact evaluation for grants programs

## Profile information

Each profile on the registry contains the following details:

* Id
* Name
* Metadata
* Owner address
* Array of member addresses

These details can be set when the profile is created using the
`createProfile` function. They can be updated by the profile owner using the
`updateProfileName` `updateProfileMetadata`
`updateProfilePendingOwner` `acceptProfileOwnership`  and
`addMembers` functions.

## Next Steps

If you are interested in running a pool, see the [Allo](/allo) page for next
steps after creating your Project Registry profile.
