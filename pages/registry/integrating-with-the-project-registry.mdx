# Integrating with the Project Registry
There are two ways to interact with the Project Registry. 
1. Through the `Registry.sol` contract
2. Through the Allo subgraph

## Writing to the Project Registry
### Create a Profile
Creating a profile is required to create a pool. Some pools may also require 
recipients or allocators to have a profile. 
`createProfile` will return a `profileId` type `bytes32`. This value will be needed for 
future calls to the registry.

```
createProfile(nonce, name, metadata, signer.address, []);
```
  #### Parameters
| name | data type | notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _nonce | uint256 | nonce is used to create the profile profileId. By providing a nonce projects can ensure having the same id across chains. |
| _name | string | The profile name. This is used to generate the anchor. |
| _metadata | Metadata | See the metadata section below for more details.|
| _owner | address | The owner of the profile. See [Roles](/roles.md) for more details about profile owners. |
| _members | address[] | Array of profile member address. [Roles](/roles.md) for more details about profile members. |

#### Metadata

Offchain metadata can be stored in the project registry using the Metadata
struct.

```solidity
struct Metadata {
    uint256 protocol;
    string pointer;
}
```
| Field | Data Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| protocol | uint256 | An id from the list of available protocols. | 
| pointer | string | The pointer to the off chain data. | 

Currently, the only protocol id available is '1' for IPFS. For more details on
details see
[`MetaPtrProtocol.sol`](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-contracts/blob/main/docs/MetaPtrProtocol.md)

### Updating a Profile

#### addMembers 
Adds member addresses to the members array.
Only the profile owner can add members.
```
addMembers(profileId, members)
```

| Field | Data Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| profileId | bytes32 | The id of the profile to update. | 
| members | address[] | Array of member address(es) to add. | 

#### removeMembers
Removes member addresses to the members array.
Only the profile owner can remove members.
`removeMembers(profileId, members)`

| Field | Data Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| profileId | bytes32 | The id of the profile to update. | 
| members | address[] | Array of member address(es) to remove. | 

#### updateProfileMetadata
Will overwrite the existing profile metadata. 
Only the owner can update profile metadata. 

`updateProfileMetadata(profileId, metadata)`
| Field | Data Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| profileId | bytes32 | The id of the profile to update. | 
| metadata | Metadata | Metadata to add to the profile. | 

#### updateProfileName
Will set a new name for the profile. 
Only the owner can update profile metadata. 
This action will create a new anchorId.

`updateProfileName(profileId, name)`
| Field | Data Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| profileId | bytes32 | The id of the profile to update. | 
| name | string | New name for the profile. | 

#### updateProfilePendingOwner
Will set a new pending owner. The pending owner will need to call 
`acceptProfileOwnership` in order for the ownership transfer to be complete.
Only the profile owner can set a pending owner. 

updateProfilePendingOwner(profileId, pendingOwner)
| Field | Data Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| profileId | bytes32 | The id of the profile to update. | 
| pendingOwner | address | The address for the new profile owner. | 

## Reading Project Registry Data Using The Graph

Project registry data is publicly available through The Graph.
See the [Indexers](../overview/indexers.md) page for links to the
latest graph.


Subgraph data can be accessed either manually through the subgraph Playground,
or programmatically through The Graph API. For more information about how to set
up these methods, please see the [Querying the
Graph](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/querying/querying-the-graph/) page in The
Graph documentation.

### Building Queries
To see the data currently available in the Allo V2 Subgraph, use the 
[Graph Playground](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/allo-protocol/allo-v2-goerli) 
and click on the explorer. You will also be able to build and test
queries directly in the UI. 

## Code Examples
<Tabs items={['js', 'solidity']}>
  <Tab>
    ```
    // This example uses js to read from the subgraph
    
    // Allo subgraph query url
    const url = `https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/allo-protocol/allo-v2-goerli`
    // define the query
    // This query returns the name of 10 most recently created profiles
    const profileQuery = ` {
      profiles(first: 10, orderBy: createdAt) 
      {
        name
      }
    }`;
    
    //prepare the request body
    const options = {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ query: profileQuery }),
    };

    //handle the response
    fetch(url, options)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
      console.log(data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.error(error);
    });

    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    ```
      // This example is modified from 'QVBaseStrategy.sol'
      // It reads data directly from the registry to see 
      // if an anchor id is a member of the profile

      //import contracts
      import {IAllo} from "../../core/interfaces/IAllo.sol";
      import {IRegistry} from "../../core/interfaces/IRegistry.sol";

      /// The registry contract. allo.getRegistry returns the registry address
      IRegistry private _registry = allo.getRegistry();;

      // function to check if anchor is a member
      function _isProfileMember(address _anchor, address _sender) internal view returns (bool) {
        IRegistry.Profile memory profile = _registry.getProfileByAnchor(_anchor);
        return _registry.isOwnerOrMemberOfProfile(profile.id, _sender);
    }

    ```
