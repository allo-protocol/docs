# Integrating with the Project Registry
There are two ways to interact with the Project Registry. 
1. Through the `Registry.sol` contract
2. Through the Indexer

## Writing to the Project Registry
### Create a Profile
Creating a profile is required to create a pool. Some pools may also require 
recipients or allocators to have a profile. 
`createProfile` will return a `profileId` type `bytes32`. This value will be needed for 
future calls to the registry.

```
createProfile(nonce, name, metadata, signer.address, []);
```
  #### Parameters
| name | data type | notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _nonce | uint256 | nonce is used to create the profile profileId. By providing a nonce projects can ensure having the same id across chains. |
| _name | string | The profile name. This is used to generate the anchor. |
| _metadata | Metadata | See the metadata section below for more details.|
| _owner | address | The owner of the profile. See [Roles](/roles.md) for more details about profile owners. |
| _members | address[] | Array of profile member address. [Roles](/roles.md) for more details about profile members. |

#### Metadata

Offchain metadata can be stored in the project registry using the Metadata
struct.

```solidity
struct Metadata {
    uint256 protocol;
    string pointer;
}
```
| Field | Data Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| protocol | uint256 | An id from the list of available protocols. | 
| pointer | string | The pointer to the off chain data. | 

Currently, the only protocol id available is '1' for IPFS. For more details on
details see
[`MetaPtrProtocol.sol`](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-contracts/blob/main/docs/MetaPtrProtocol.md)

### Updating a Profile

#### addMembers 
Adds member addresses to the members array.
Only the profile owner can add members.
```
addMembers(profileId, members)
```

| Field | Data Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| profileId | bytes32 | The id of the profile to update. | 
| members | address[] | Array of member address(es) to add. | 

#### removeMembers
Removes member addresses to the members array.
Only the profile owner can remove members.
`removeMembers(profileId, members)`

| Field | Data Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| profileId | bytes32 | The id of the profile to update. | 
| members | address[] | Array of member address(es) to remove. | 

#### updateProfileMetadata
Will overwrite the existing profile metadata. 
Only the owner can update profile metadata. 

`updateProfileMetadata(profileId, metadata)`
| Field | Data Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| profileId | bytes32 | The id of the profile to update. | 
| metadata | Metadata | Metadata to add to the profile. | 

#### updateProfileName
Will set a new name for the profile. 
Only the owner can update profile metadata. 
This action will create a new anchorId.

`updateProfileName(profileId, name)`
| Field | Data Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| profileId | bytes32 | The id of the profile to update. | 
| name | string | New name for the profile. | 

#### updateProfilePendingOwner
Will set a new pending owner. The pending owner will need to call 
`acceptProfileOwnership` in order for the ownership transfer to be complete.
Only the profile owner can set a pending owner. 

updateProfilePendingOwner(profileId, pendingOwner)
| Field | Data Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| profileId | bytes32 | The id of the profile to update. | 
| pendingOwner | address | The address for the new profile owner. | 

## Reading Project Registry Data Using Indexer

Project registry data is publicly available through Indexer.
See the [Indexer Project](/indexer/project) page.
