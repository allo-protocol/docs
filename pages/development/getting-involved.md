# Getting Involved

Thank you for your desire to build with Allo!
Below you will find some ways to start, but please don't feel limited by them. 

## Join the Community

We maintain an [Allo Devs Telegram](https://t.me/+2OHfGICIvPQxODFh) group that
is a good resource for asking questions, getting feedback on ideas, and
connecting with other developers.

Another great place to discuss among community and developers is the
[Gitcoin Discord](https://discord.gg/gitcoin).

This server has dedicated  `⁠👷🏾|grants-lab-builders` & `⁠🔨|allo-protocol-builders` 
channels. Find them by agreeing to the server rules, and from the `👋|start-here`
channel gaining the **DAO Visitor** role. Then from the new `👋🏾|dao-start-here`
channel react with `⚒️` to get access to these dedicated builder spaces.


## Building

A great way to get involved is to create your own [allocation
strategy](/strategies). The pieces of an allocation strategy give you a lot of
room to explore and play around with different mechanisms.

Another way to contribute to the Allo ecosystem is to build new tools (front
ends, apps, products, etc) for communities to allocate capital. Allo Protocol
serves as the base-layer, but we need devs like you to build interesting
products on top of it!

When in doubt, post in the above `⁠🔨|allo-protocol-builders` channel or 
the Allo Devs Telegram group.
