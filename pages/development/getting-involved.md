# Getting Involved

Thank you for your desire to build with Allo!
Below you will find some ways to start, but please don't feel limited by them. 

## Join the Community

* We maintain an [Allo Devs Telegram](https://t.me/+2OHfGICIvPQxODFh) group that
is a good resource for asking questions, getting feedback on ideas, and
connecting with other developers.

* Another great place to discuss among community and developers is the
[Gitcoin Discord](https://discord.gg/gitcoin).
This server has dedicated  `⁠👷🏾|grants-lab-builders` & `⁠🔨|allo-protocol-builders` 
channels. Find them by agreeing to the server rules, and from the `👋|start-here`
channel gaining the **DAO Visitor** role. Then from the new `👋🏾|dao-start-here`
channel react with `⚒️` to get access to these dedicated builder spaces.


## Building

A powerful way to master the protocol is to create your own [strategy](/strategies).
The pieces of an allocation strategy give you a lot of
room to explore and play around with different mechanisms.

Another way to contribute to the Allo ecosystem is to build new tools (front
ends, apps, products, etc) for communities to allocate capital. [Allo.Expert](https://allo.expert/)
is a great place to dive deeper on this.

When in doubt, post in the above `⁠🔨|allo-protocol-builders` channel or 
the Allo Devs Telegram group.
