# Profile

## Introduction
Profiles contain details about Allo participants. An Allo registry profile is 
required to create a pool. It is also recommended that strategies use Allo 
profiles for their recipients, but it is not required. 

## Profile Structure
```solidity
struct Profile {
    uint256 nonce;
    string name;
    Metadata metadata;
    address owner;
    address anchor;
}
```
| Field | Data Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| nonce | uint256 |  | 
| name | string | The profile name. | 
| metadata | Metadata | See the metadata section below for more details.|
| owner | address | The wallet address of the profile owner. |
| anchor | address | The unique id assigned to the profile when it is created. |

### Metadata
Offchain metadata can be stored in the project registry using the Metadata 
struct.
```solidity
struct Metadata {
    uint256 protocol;
    string pointer;
}
```
| Field | Data Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| protocol | uint256 | An id from the list of available protocols. | 
| pointer | string | The pointer to the off chain data. | 

Currently, the only protocol id available is '1' for IPFS. For more details on
details see [`MetaPtrProtocol.sol`](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-contracts/blob/main/docs/MetaPtrProtocol.md)

## Creating and Updating Profiles
See the [Create Profile](/project-registry/create-profile) and [Update Profile](/project-registry/update-profile)
